# landonkea-ytmusic-ios

A free, open-source YouTube Music client for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

## Features

- Search for songs, artists, and albums
- Play music from YouTube's vast library
- Background audio playback
- Mini player with playback controls
- Full-screen player with progress bar
- AirPlay support
- No ads, no subscription required

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+ / macOS 14.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

## Setup

1. Open Xcode
2. File → New → Project
3. Choose "iOS" → "App"
4. Product Name: `YTMusic`
5. Organization Identifier: `com.landonkea`
6. Interface: SwiftUI
7. Language: Swift
8. Save the project in this folder
9. In Xcode, go to File → Add Package Dependencies
10. Add this local package (the folder you're in)

## How It Works

This app uses YouTube's InnerTube API - the same internal API that the official YouTube Music app uses. By pretending to be the official iOS YouTube Music client, we can:

- Search for any song
- Get streaming URLs
- Play audio without ads

## Technical Details

- **API Client**: Talks directly to YouTube's InnerTube servers
- **Audio Playback**: Uses AVFoundation for native audio playback
- **UI**: Built with SwiftUI for a native Apple feel
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

## Mac Catalyst

The app builds as a native Mac app via Mac Catalyst — same codebase, no
separate macOS target. Build it with:

```
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme YTMusicApp -destination 'platform=macOS,variant=Mac Catalyst' build
```

**Local builds need an ad-hoc signing override.** Unlike the iOS
Simulator, Xcode's "Automatic" signing with no development team refuses to
sign a Mac Catalyst build ("Signing for ... requires a development team").
This repo has no committed signing team (see `Setup` above), so build/test
locally with:

```
xcodebuild -scheme YTMusicApp -destination 'platform=macOS,variant=Mac Catalyst' \
  build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

(the same override works with `test` in place of `build`; all 13 unit
tests pass under Catalyst). With a real Apple Developer team configured in
Xcode, plain "Automatic" signing works with no extra flags.

### What works

- Playback, search, browse, downloads, lyrics, equalizer, playlists — the
  app compiled and ran under Catalyst with **no source changes**. UIKit,
  AVFoundation/AVAudioSession, MediaPlayer, BackgroundTasks, Speech, and
  Intents all link and run fine in the Catalyst runtime.
- The Home Screen / Lock Screen Now Playing widget (`YTMusicWidgetExtension`)
  embeds and builds for Catalyst too — WidgetKit widgets from a Catalyst
  app surface in macOS's Notification Center widget gallery the same way
  Home Screen widgets do on iOS, with no extension-specific code changes
  required.

### Known limitations (not verified beyond compiling/running locally)

- **Lock screen / Control Center semantics differ.** `MPRemoteCommandCenter`
  and `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` still work under Catalyst, but there's no
  literal "lock screen" on a Mac — the same remote-command wiring instead
  surfaces playback controls in macOS's Control Center / media widget and
  the Touch Bar (where present). This was not manually verified on real
  Mac hardware in this change, only confirmed to build/link.
- **`AVAudioSession` category/options are largely advisory on Mac** — there
  is no silent switch and background-audio behavior is governed by normal
  macOS app lifecycle rules, not iOS's background modes. `setupAudioSession()`
  and `VoiceSearchManager`'s `activateAudioSession()` still call
  `AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()` and don't throw, but the `.mixWithOthers`
  / `.duckOthers` options may have no visible effect on Mac.
- **App Group-backed widget sync has the same no-signing-team caveat as iOS**
  (see `YTMusicApp.entitlements`): without a real Apple Developer team and
  provisioning profile, `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` may resolve to nil on
  Mac too, so the widget's shared "now playing" state should be considered
  unverified until built with real signing.
- Haptics (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`/`UINotificationFeedbackGenerator` in
  `Haptics.swift`) compile unchanged and no-op silently on Mac (no Taptic
  Engine) — confirmed by reading Apple's documented Catalyst behavior, not
  by feeling for a vibration that can't exist on this hardware.

## CloudKit Sync

Playlists and liked songs (only — not listening stats/play counts) sync
across a user's devices via their private iCloud database. See
`Sources/YTMusicApp/Services/CloudKitSyncManager.swift` for the full
design writeup (why raw CloudKit instead of `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`,
the conflict-resolution rules, and known limitations like no deletion sync
and no push-based `CKSubscription`).

**What's verified in this environment (no signing team, no iCloud account):**
- `CloudKitRecordCoding`'s `Playlist`/`LikedSongEntry` <-> `CKRecord`
  encode/decode round trips (`CKRecord` can be constructed with no network
  or entitlements).
- `PlaylistConflictResolver` / `LikedSongConflictResolver` — pure
  last-write-wins-by-timestamp merge logic, no CloudKit types involved.
- `CloudKitSyncManager`'s full pull/merge/apply/push orchestration, run
  against `InMemoryCloudRecordStore` (an in-memory fake conforming to the
  same `CloudRecordStore` protocol the real `CKDatabaseRecordStore` does).
- `xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild build`/`test` compile and pass cleanly
  with the `CloudKit.framework` link and the iCloud container entitlement
  in place.

See `Tests/YTMusicAppTests/CloudKitSyncTests.swift` for all of the above.

**What is NOT verified here, and needs a real device/simulator signed into
iCloud with a real Apple Developer team provisioning
`iCloud.com.landonkea.ytmusic`:**
- That `CKDatabaseRecordStore` (the thin adapter over a real `CKDatabase`)
  actually talks to CloudKit correctly — zone creation, record
  save/fetch/delete against Apple's servers.
- Real cross-device sync behavior (two physical/simulated devices
  converging on the same merged state).
- `com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers` / `-icloud-services`
  entitlements resolving to a real, usable container — in local/CI builds
  without a signing team, `CKContainer` operations fail with a
  "not authenticated"/no-account error, which `performSync()` catches and
  logs, skipping the sync pass rather than crashing. Local playlists/liked
  songs remain fully usable offline either way — this only affects
  cross-device sync, the same category of caveat as the widget's App Group
  (see Mac Catalyst section above).

## Running Tests

```
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

This runs `xcodegen generate` followed by `xcodebuild test` against the
first available iPhone simulator, then writes a summary report to
`test-results/latest.md` (pass/fail counts, timestamp, and any failures).
The full raw `xcodebuild` log is saved alongside it at
`test-results/raw.log`. Both are gitignored — generated locally and, in CI,
uploaded as a workflow artifact (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
