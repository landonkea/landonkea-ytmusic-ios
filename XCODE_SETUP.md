# Xcode Setup & Next Steps

## Current Setup (working, verified)

The Xcode project is **generated from `project.yml` with [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)**.
`.xcodeproj` is gitignored, so it must be regenerated whenever source files are
added/removed or `project.yml` changes.

- **Single monolithic target** named `YTMusicApp` compiling BOTH
  `Sources/YTMusicApp` and `Sources/YTMusicAPI` as one module.
  The API types have no `public` access modifiers, so they cannot live in a
  separate module.
- **Bundle ID:** `com.landonkea.ytmusic`
- **Deployment target:** iOS 17.0
- **Privacy usage strings** live in `project.yml` (they must stay there — the
  app crashes without `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` and
  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`).
- **Secrets** (currently just the InnerTube API key) are injected via
  `Config/Secrets.xcconfig`, which is gitignored. Before your first build,
  copy `Config/Secrets.example.xcconfig` to `Config/Secrets.xcconfig` — the
  example file documents every key and has the real (public) InnerTube key
  value in its comments. Without this file the app builds but crashes on
  launch with a clear `fatalError` message telling you what to do.

### 0. One-time secrets setup
```bash
cp Config/Secrets.example.xcconfig Config/Secrets.xcconfig
# then edit Config/Secrets.xcconfig and fill in INNERTUBE_API_KEY
# (see the comment in Secrets.example.xcconfig for the value/explanation)
```

### 1. Build & Run (command line)
```bash
export DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer   # required for every non-interactive build
xcodegen generate                                                 # recreate the .xcodeproj
xcodebuild -project YTMusicApp.xcodeproj -scheme YTMusicApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  -configuration Debug build
```

### 2. Install & Launch on a Simulator
```bash
export DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
# Point APP at the DerivedData build product:
APP=~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/YTMusicApp-*/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/YTMusicApp.app
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 17" || true
xcrun simctl install "iPhone 17" "$APP"
xcrun simctl launch "iPhone 17" com.landonkea.ytmusic
```

### 3. Open in Xcode
```bash
xcodegen generate
open YTMusicApp.xcodeproj
```
Product → Run (Cmd+R). If signing is needed, set your Apple ID team and the
bundle ID stays `com.landonkea.ytmusic`.

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme YTMusicApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'
```
Or use the test navigator in Xcode.

### Package.swift / Swift Package Manager
`Package.swift` mirrors the single-module structure (one executable target that
compiles both `Sources/YTMusicApp` and `Sources/YTMusicAPI`). It exists so the
package layout stays valid and tools that parse the package work.

**Note:** `swift build` on a Mac cannot produce a runnable iOS app — SwiftPM
lacks a bundled iOS destination, so it cannot cross-link iOS executables. This
is an Apple tooling limitation, not a project bug. The real build path is
`xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild` above.

## Resolved Gaps (log of known gaps that have been fixed)

### SongDetailView download
- **Before:** the download button called `offlineManager.download(...)` with the
  thumbnail URL as the audio URL, so downloads had no real audio.
- **Fixed:** the button now fetches a real stream URL via
  `apiClient.getPlayerInfoForDownload(videoId:)` (a per-song download variant
  of the player API) and passes that audio URL to
  `offlineManager.download(videoId:title:artist:audioUrl:thumbnailUrl:)`.
- The button shows a spinner + "Downloading..." and guards against starting a
  second download for the same song.

### Equalizer (real audio processing)
- **Before:** `EqualizerManager.applyGainsToEQ()` was a stub — sliders updated
  values but nothing reached the audio.
- **Fixed:** new `Services/EqualizerEngine.swift` runs playback through an
  `AVAudioEngine` graph (`playerNode → AVAudioUnitTimePitch → AVAudioUnitEQ(10
  bands) → mainMixer`). It supports play/pause/resume/stop/seek, rate, volume,
  EQ gain updates, a 0.25s position timer, and an end-of-song callback.
- `AudioPlayer` now routes playback through the engine whenever EQ is enabled
  AND the song is a local/downloaded file (`url.isFileURL`). Streamed songs
  still use AVPlayer because AVPlayer cannot be equalized.
- `EqualizerManager.shared` is wired in `YTMusicApp.init`; gain changes flow to
  the active engine via an `onGainsChanged` callback.
- **Known limitation:** because EQ requires the AVAudioEngine path, enabling EQ
  affects only downloaded/local songs (which is also the only place real EQ is
  technically possible on iOS today).

### Package.swift / SPM structure
- **Before:** two targets (`YTMusicApp` depending on `YTMusicAPI`), which could
  never build because the API module's types are all internal.
- **Fixed:** single executable target that compiles both source folders as one
  module, matching the xcodegen setup.
- See the "Package.swift / Swift Package Manager" note above for the macOS
  cross-link limitation.

## Features Blocked by Xcode

- Deep link taps open the app to the player

#### 2. Live Activities (Dynamic Island)
- Add a `LiveActivity` extension target
- Show now-playing info on the Dynamic Island / Lock Screen

- Update via `LiveActivityManager` when the song changes

#### 3. CarPlay
- Add a `CPTemplateApplicationScene` to the Info.plist
