// NowPlayingProvider.swift — Supplies timeline entries to NowPlayingWidget.
//
// HOW WIDGETKIT TIMELINES WORK:
// A widget doesn't run continuously like the main app — the system asks a
// `TimelineProvider` for a `Timeline` (a list of entries, each with a date),
// then renders whichever entry's date has most recently passed, on its own
// schedule. Widgets don't "poll"; instead the app proactively calls
// `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadTimelines(ofKind:)` (see
// AudioPlayer.updateWidgetSnapshot(song:)) whenever the song or play/pause
// state changes, which makes WidgetKit re-invoke `getTimeline` here.
//
// Because the app already pushes a reload on every meaningful change, this
// provider only ever needs to hand back a single-entry timeline with
// `.never` as the refresh policy — "never refresh on your own; wait for the
// app to tell you." The one exception is a *playing* song's progress bar,
// which needs to keep moving between app-driven reloads — that's handled by
// `NowPlayingSnapshot.projectedElapsedSeconds` computing from the wall
// clock rather than needing a new timeline entry every second.
