// NowPlayingSnapshot.swift — Shared "what's playing right now" state.
//
// WHY THIS FILE LIVES IN ITS OWN MODULE FOLDER (Sources/YTMusicShared):
// The Home Screen / Lock Screen widget (Sources/YTMusicWidget) runs in a
// separate OS process from the main app (Sources/YTMusicApp) — it's a
// distinct extension target with its own sandbox. It cannot read
// AudioPlayer's @Published properties directly. Both targets compile this
// same file (see project.yml's `sources:` for each target), so they share
// one definition of the data that crosses the process boundary, instead of
// two independently-maintained copies that could drift out of sync.
//
// HOW DATA CROSSES THE PROCESS BOUNDARY:
// The app and the widget extension both belong to the same "App Group" —
// a sandboxed container both processes are allowed to read/write (declared
// in YTMusicApp.entitlements and YTMusicWidget.entitlements). We use
// UserDefaults(suiteName:) scoped to that App Group as a lightweight
// key-value store: cheap to write on every playback-state change, no file
// locking to worry about, and small enough (one song's worth of text) that
// JSON-encoding it into a single UserDefaults key is simpler than managing
// a shared file.
