// MARK: - Skeleton View

/// A placeholder view with a shimmer animation for loading states.
///
/// Shows a gray rectangle with a moving gradient that creates a "shimmer" effect.
/// Used to indicate content is loading, giving the user visual feedback that
/// something is happening (better than a blank screen or spinner).
///
/// GLOSSARY (terms explained here the first time they appear in this file):
/// - **struct**: a Swift value type. Every SwiftUI view is a `struct` that
///   conforms to (adopts the rules of) the `View` protocol.
/// - **protocol**: a contract that says "any type that conforms to me must
///   provide these things." `View` requires a `body` computed property.
/// - **computed property**: a property (like `body`) whose value is calculated
///   by running code each time it's accessed, instead of being stored in memory.
/// - **@State**: a property wrapper (a special annotation starting with `@`)
///   that tells SwiftUI "this value can change over time, and when it does,
///   redraw any view that depends on it." State only lives as long as the view
///   is on screen.
/// - **view modifier**: a method like `.fill(...)`, `.frame(...)`, or
///   `.cornerRadius(...)` that returns a new, modified version of a view.
///   Modifiers are chained together to build up a view's final appearance.
/// - **declarative UI**: instead of writing step-by-step instructions for how
///   to draw and update the screen, you describe *what* the UI should look like
///   for a given state, and SwiftUI figures out how to make the screen match.
