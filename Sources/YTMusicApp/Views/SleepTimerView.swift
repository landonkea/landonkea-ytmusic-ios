/// A modal view that allows the user to set a sleep timer for music playback.

/// "End of current track" option. When a preset is selected, the timer is activated
/// on the audio player and the modal is dismissed. If a timer is already active,
/// the view shows the remaining time and a cancel button.
///
/// NOTE ON STYLE: The `body` property below is kept intentionally small. Instead of
/// writing one giant block of nested views, each section of the screen is broken out
/// into its own small "computed property" (a property whose value is calculated by
/// running code, rather than stored directly — declared with `var name: Type { ... }`).
/// This mirrors how you'd break a long function into smaller helper functions: it makes
/// each piece easier to read, name, and reason about on its own.
