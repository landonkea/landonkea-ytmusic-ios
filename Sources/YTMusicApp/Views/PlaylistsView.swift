import SwiftUI
// ^ Import Apple's SwiftUI framework for building user interfaces

/// The Library tab showing downloaded songs and local playlists.
///
/// This is the main library screen where users can:
/// - View their downloaded songs for offline playback
/// - Create and manage local playlists
/// - Tap a playlist to see its songs
///
/// GLOSSARY (terms explained here the first time they appear in this file):
/// - **@EnvironmentObject**: reads a shared object injected by a parent view
///   via `.environmentObject(...)`, instead of being passed in explicitly.
///   The view automatically re-renders when that object's data changes.
/// - **@State**: a property wrapper for small pieces of view-local state kept
///   only in memory. Changing it tells SwiftUI to redraw whatever part of the
///   view depends on it.
/// - **Binding**: a two-way, live connection to a value owned elsewhere. A
///   `$` prefix (e.g. `$newPlaylistName`) turns a `@State` property into a
///   `Binding` that a control like `TextField` can both read and write.
/// - **NavigationLink**: a tappable row that pushes a new screen onto the
///   navigation stack when tapped — the standard way to drill down from a
///   list into a detail view in SwiftUI.
/// - **guard**: an early-exit check — `guard condition else { return }` means
///   "require this to be true, otherwise stop here," keeping the rest of the
///   function free of extra nested `if` indentation.
