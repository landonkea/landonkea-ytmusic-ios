import SwiftUI
// ^ Import Apple's SwiftUI framework for building user interfaces

/// Shows all downloaded songs available for offline playback.
///
/// Displayed in the Library tab. Users can:
/// - Tap a song to play it from cache (no internet needed)
/// - Swipe to delete individual songs
/// - Clear all downloads (with confirmation)
/// - See storage usage and download count
///
/// GLOSSARY (terms explained here the first time they appear in this file):
/// - **@EnvironmentObject**: reads a shared object that some ancestor view
///   injected into the app's "environment" (via `.environmentObject(...)`),
///   instead of it being passed down explicitly through initializers. The
///   view automatically re-renders whenever that object's data changes.
/// - **@State**: a property wrapper for small pieces of view-local, in-memory
///   state. When a `@State` value changes, SwiftUI re-runs `body` to update
///   the screen. It resets whenever the view itself is thrown away and recreated.
/// - **optional**: a Swift type that can either hold a value or hold nothing
///   (`nil`). Written as `Type?`, e.g. `URL?`. Optionals force you to handle
///   the "there might be nothing here" case explicitly, which is why you'll
///   see `guard let` and `if let` throughout this codebase.
/// - **guard**: an early-exit check. `guard condition else { return }` reads
///   as "make sure this is true, otherwise stop right here." It's preferred
///   over deeply nested `if` blocks because the "happy path" code that
///   follows doesn't need to be indented inside an `if`.
