import SwiftUI
// NOTE: This file previously also imported UniformTypeIdentifiers, but nothing
// here actually uses it (no UTType values appear anywhere below), so it was
// removed. An unused import doesn't crash anything, but it's dead code —
// it makes a reader wonder "wait, where is this used?" for no reason.

/// Settings screen where users can customize app behavior.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// - Uses `@AppStorage` to persist settings in UserDefaults (iOS key-value store)
/// - Settings are automatically saved when changed and loaded on app launch
/// - Some settings (like streamQuality) are stored but not yet wired up to AudioPlayer
/// - Future work: connect these to actual behavior + add login for YouTube Music account
///
/// GLOSSARY (terms explained here the first time they appear in this file):
/// - **property wrapper**: a `@SomethingLikeThis` annotation placed before a
///   property that changes how that property is stored/read/written behind
///   the scenes. `@AppStorage`, `@State`, and `@EnvironmentObject` (below) are
///   all property wrappers.
/// - **@EnvironmentObject**: reads a shared object that some ancestor view
///   injected into the "environment" (with `.environmentObject(...)`), rather
///   than the object being passed down explicitly through every initializer.
///   Any view can reach into the environment for it, and the view
///   automatically refreshes whenever that object's published data changes.
/// - **Binding**: a two-way connection to a value owned somewhere else. A `$`
///   prefix on a state property (e.g. `$darkMode`) creates a `Binding<Bool>`
///   that a control like `Toggle` can both read from and write to, so the
///   toggle changes the *real* underlying value, not a copy of it.
/// - **closure**: a self-contained block of code (like `{ showClearCacheAlert = true }`)
///   that can be passed around and executed later — used heavily as button
///   actions and callback handlers throughout SwiftUI.
