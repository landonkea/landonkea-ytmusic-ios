/// Displays lyrics for the currently playing song.
///
/// Supports two modes:
/// 1. **Synced mode**: Highlights the current line as the song plays (karaoke-style)
/// 2. **Plain mode**: Shows all lyrics as scrollable text (when synced not available)
///
/// Also supports translation to other languages via a translate button.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// - Fetches lyrics from lrclib.net when the song changes
/// - Uses a Timer to check playback position every 0.5 seconds
/// - Scrolls to and highlights the line that matches the current time
/// - Falls back to plain text if synced lyrics aren't available
/// - Users can tap translate to see lyrics in another language
