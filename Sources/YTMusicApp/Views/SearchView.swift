// MARK: - Main Search View

/// The search screen where users find songs, artists, and albums on YouTube Music.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// 1. User types in the search bar → suggestions appear as they type
/// 2. User taps search (or a suggestion) → results load from YouTube's API
/// 3. User taps a result → song starts playing
/// 4. User long-presses a result → context menu with Play/Play Next/Add to Queue
///
/// This view manages 4 states: idle, typing suggestions, loading, and results.
///
/// NOTE ON STRUCTURE: SwiftUI views describe *what* the screen should look
/// like for the current data ("declarative UI"), and SwiftUI takes care of
/// drawing (and redrawing) it whenever that data changes. A `View` here is a
/// `struct` (a lightweight value type — copied rather than shared by
/// reference) that conforms to the `View` protocol, meaning it promises a
/// `body` computed property describing its contents. This file is the
/// largest view in the app, so to keep it readable it's broken into several
/// small, independently-named types (`SearchBar`, `SuggestionsList`,
/// `SearchResultsList`, etc.) and, within `SearchView` itself, several small
/// computed properties (`filterBar`, `resultsSection`, etc.) that `body`
/// assembles like puzzle pieces instead of nesting everything inline.
struct SearchView: View {

    /// The API client handles all YouTube Music API calls.
    /// Injected via `@EnvironmentObject` — a property wrapper that reads a
    /// shared object out of the SwiftUI "environment" (a bag of shared data
    /// available to a view and all of its children) instead of it being
    /// passed in explicitly. That's how child views like `SearchResultsList`
    /// can also reach the same `APIClient` without us threading it through
    /// every initializer by hand.
