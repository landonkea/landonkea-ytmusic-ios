/// step-by-step instructions for how to draw the screen, you describe WHAT
/// the screen should look like for the current data, and SwiftUI figures out
/// how to draw (and redraw) it. A `View` in this codebase is usually a
/// `struct` (a lightweight value type) that conforms to the `View` protocol —
/// meaning it promises to provide a `body` computed property describing its
/// contents. To keep any single `body` from becoming a giant wall of code,
/// this file breaks the screen into several small computed properties (like
/// `albumArtSection`, `statsSection`, etc.) that each return "some View" —
/// a piece of UI — which `body` then assembles like puzzle pieces.
