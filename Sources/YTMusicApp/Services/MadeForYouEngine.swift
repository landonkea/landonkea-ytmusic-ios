// MARK: - Made For You Engine

/// Builds a "Made For You" style auto-generated mix from listening history.
///
/// NOT an ObservableObject / NOT a long-lived shared instance — this is a
/// stateless, one-shot builder. HomeView calls `build(...)` once (in a
/// `.task`) and stores the result in local `@State`, the same way it already
/// handles `apiClient.getRelated` elsewhere. There's nothing here that needs
/// to persist or be observed continuously.
///
/// HOW THE MIX IS BUILT (item #1 from the research pass):
/// 1. Take the user's top artists from StatsManager (real listening data,
///    now skip-aware — see StatsManager's reconciliation notes).
/// 2. For each top artist, use one of their most-played songs as a "seed"
///    and fetch YouTube's own related-songs graph for it (`getRelated`).
/// 3. Merge all the candidates, drop duplicates and anything already in the
///    user's top-played list (a "Made For You" mix should surface things
///    adjacent to what's loved, not just replay it — `MostPlayedSection`
///    already covers replaying).
/// 4. Drop anything StatsManager knows the user tends to skip.
/// 5. Interleave (round-robin across seed artists) instead of concatenating,
///    so the mix doesn't front-load 5 songs related to the #1 artist before
///    ever mentioning artist #2.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - stats: Source of top artists / most played / skip signal.

    ///   - limit: Max songs in the final mix.
    /// - Returns: A blended list of `SearchResult`s, ready to display and
    ///   play (streaming URL is resolved lazily on tap, same as every other
    ///   browse card in the app).
