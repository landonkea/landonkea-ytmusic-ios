// MARK: - Equalizer Manager

/// Manages equalizer settings (presets, band gains) and pushes them
/// to the active playback engine.
///
/// WHAT IS AN EQUALIZER?
/// An equalizer (EQ) adjusts the volume of different frequency ranges in audio.
/// - Bass (low frequencies): 60Hz-250Hz — the "thump" you feel in your chest
/// - Mids (mid frequencies): 250Hz-4kHz — vocals, guitars, most instruments
/// - Treble (high frequencies): 4kHz-16kHz — cymbals, hi-hats, sparkle
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// This class is the "brains" of the EQ — it stores the settings and
/// exposes methods the UI calls (applyPreset, setBand, toggle). It does
/// NOT own the audio processing itself. The actual equalizer lives in
/// EqualizerEngine (AVAudioUnitEQ inside an AVAudioEngine), which is used
/// by AudioPlayer for LOCAL file playback. This manager pushes the gains
/// to that engine through the `onGainsChanged` callback.
///
/// WHY NOT EVERYTHING?
/// iOS does not let apps insert an equalizer into AVPlayer's audio path.
/// Streamed songs therefore cannot be equalized — the equalizer only
/// affects downloaded (offline) songs played through EqualizerEngine.
///
/// We provide presets (Flat, Bass Boost, etc.) that set all 10 bands at once
/// for common listening scenarios.
///
/// WHAT IS "ObservableObject"?
/// This is a protocol (a contract a type promises to follow) from SwiftUI's
/// Combine-based data flow. Conforming to it means SwiftUI views can
/// "subscribe" to this object and automatically redraw themselves whenever
/// one of its `@Published` properties changes — we never have to manually
/// tell the UI to refresh.
class EqualizerManager: ObservableObject {
    
    // MARK: - Shared Instance

    /// and what gains to apply. This mirrors the PlayCountManager.shared pattern.

    /// This property wrapper (a special annotation that adds behavior to a
    /// stored property) automatically announces changes to this value to
    /// anything observing this object (like a SwiftUI view). Whenever
    /// `isEnabled` is set to a new value, every view reading it re-renders.
