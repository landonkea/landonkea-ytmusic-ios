// MARK: - Stats Manager

/// Tracks listening statistics — total time, top songs, daily streaks, etc.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// - Records a "listen session" every time a song is played
/// - Each session stores: videoId, title, artist, duration played, timestamp
/// - Aggregates are computed from the raw session data
///
/// DATA STORED:
/// - Total time listened (in seconds)
/// - Total songs played
/// - Most-played songs (by play count)
/// - Listening history (last 500 sessions)
///
/// PERSISTENCE:
/// - Stored as JSON in the Documents directory
/// - Capped at the most recent 500 sessions (see `trimToMaxSessions()`) —
///   older sessions are dropped by count, not by age, to keep the saved
///   file small.
