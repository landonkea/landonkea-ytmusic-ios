// MARK: - Lyrics Translator

/// Translates lyrics text to another language using a free translation API.
///
/// WHAT THIS DOES:
/// Takes lyrics text (either a single string or synced lines) and translates
/// them to the target language. Users can toggle between original and translated
/// lyrics while listening to a song.
///
/// TRANSLATION API:
/// Uses MyMemory (mymemory.translated.net) — a free, no-auth translation API.
/// It's based on Google Translate and other open-source translation engines.
/// Rate limit: 5000 characters/day for anonymous users (enough for ~10 songs).
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// 1. User taps "Translate" in the lyrics view
/// 2. We send the lyrics text to the translation API
/// 3. API returns translated text
/// 4. We display the translated lyrics (or toggle between original/translated)
///
/// LIMITATIONS:
/// - Free API has daily character limits
/// - Song lyrics may not translate perfectly (poetic language, slang)
/// - Synced timestamps are preserved (we translate text, not timing)
///
/// WHAT IS "ObservableObject"?
/// A SwiftUI/Combine protocol. Conforming to it lets views "observe" this
/// object and auto-refresh whenever an `@Published` property changes, with
/// no manual UI-refresh code needed.
class LyricsTranslator: ObservableObject {
