// MARK: - CloudKit Sync — Playlists & Liked Songs Only
//
// SCOPE: This syncs exactly two things across a user's devices via their
// private iCloud database: user-created `Playlist`s (PlaylistManager) and
// liked/favorited song IDs (LikedSongsManager). It intentionally does NOT
// sync play counts, listening stats, queue history, or anything else —
// that's out of scope by design, see StatsManager/PlayCountManager which
// remain purely local.
//
// DESIGN DECISION — raw CloudKit (CKContainer/CKRecord), NOT
// NSPersistentCloudKitContainer / Core Data:
//
// This app does not use Core Data anywhere. Playlists are a JSON file in
// the Documents directory (see PlaylistManager.swift) and liked songs are a
// UserDefaults-backed Set<String> (see LikedSongsManager.swift). Migrating
// either to Core Data purely to get NSPersistentCloudKitContainer's
// automatic sync would mean:
//   1. Rewriting `Playlist`/`NowPlaying` as NSManagedObject subclasses (or a
//      value-type facade over them), which ripples into every view that
//      touches `Playlist.songs`, `PlaylistManager.playlists`, etc. — a wide,
//      app-touching refactor exactly of the kind this session was asked to
//      avoid (a concurrent session is editing lyrics/sleep-timer files;
//      minimizing overlap in shared/app-wide files matters).
//   2. Discarding a working, simple, well-tested JSON/UserDefaults storage
//      layer that has nothing wrong with it — CloudKit sync doesn't need
//      Core Data underneath it; NSPersistentCloudKitContainer is a
//      convenience for apps that were ALREADY on Core Data, not a
//      prerequisite for CloudKit sync in general.
//
// Instead, this file layers a sync engine directly on top of the existing
// storage: it reads/writes the same `Playlist` and liked-song data
// PlaylistManager/LikedSongsManager already own, encodes it into CKRecords,
// and merges local vs. remote with an explicit (and unit-testable) conflict
// resolution rule. The two managers gained the minimum surface needed to
// participate (a `modifiedAt` stamp on `Playlist`, per-ID like timestamps in
// LikedSongsManager, and a change notification each) — see the comments in
// PlaylistManager.swift and LikedSongsManager.swift for exactly what
// changed there.
