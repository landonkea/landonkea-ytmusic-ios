// EqualizerEngine.swift — Plays local audio files through a real 10-band
// equalizer using AVAudioEngine.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS:
// AVPlayer (used for normal playback) does NOT let apps insert an
// equalizer into its audio pipeline. So this class provides an
// ALTERNATIVE playback path that uses AVAudioEngine + AVAudioPlayerNode +
// AVAudioUnitEQ. AudioPlayer uses this engine only when:
//   1. The user has the equalizer turned ON, AND
//   2. The song is being played from a LOCAL file (a downloaded song).
// Streamed songs keep using AVPlayer, which cannot be equalized on iOS.
//
// AUDIO GRAPH:
//   AVAudioPlayerNode  →  AVAudioUnitTimePitch (playback speed)  →
//   AVAudioUnitEQ (10 bands)  →  mainMixerNode  →  output
//
// All methods are marked @MainActor because the engine is driven from the
// UI thread (timers, play/pause buttons, sliders).
