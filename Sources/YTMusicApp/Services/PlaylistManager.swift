// MARK: - Playlist Manager

/// Manages local playlists — create, rename, delete, add/remove songs.
///
/// WHAT THIS DOES:
/// Users can create playlists to organize their favorite songs. Playlists
/// are stored locally on the device (no login required). Each playlist has
/// a name, creation date, and list of songs.
///
/// STORAGE:
/// Playlists are saved as a JSON file in the Documents directory.
/// Each playlist is a simple struct with a name and array of NowPlaying songs.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// 1. User taps "New Playlist" in the Library tab
/// 2. They enter a name and tap Create
/// 3. From any song's context menu, they tap "Add to Playlist"
/// 4. They select which playlist to add to
/// 5. The song is appended to that playlist and saved to disk
/// 6. Tapping a playlist shows its songs
/// 7. Tapping a song in the playlist starts playing from that playlist
///
/// This is a `class` (not a `struct`) so that a single shared instance's
/// data is visible everywhere in the app — SwiftUI views hold a reference
/// to this same object rather than getting their own disconnected copies.
/// `ObservableObject` lets SwiftUI views watch it and redraw automatically
/// when `@Published` data changes.

    /// All user-created playlists, sorted by creation date (newest first).

    /// observing this object whenever the array changes, so the UI
    /// automatically refreshes to show the new state.
