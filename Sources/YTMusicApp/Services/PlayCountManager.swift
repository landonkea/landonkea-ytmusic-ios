// MARK: - Play Count Manager

/// Tracks how many times each song has been played and when it was last played.
///
/// WHAT THIS DOES:
/// Every time a song starts playing, we increment its play count and record
/// the timestamp. This data can be used to:
/// - Show "Most Played" section on the home screen
/// - Sort playlists by play count
/// - Show listening stats to the user
///
/// STORAGE:
/// Play counts are stored as a dictionary mapping video IDs to play counts.
/// Last played timestamps are stored separately. Both are persisted to JSON
/// files in the Documents directory.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// AudioPlayer calls recordPlay() whenever a new song starts playing.
/// The manager increments the count and saves to disk. Views can call
/// getPlayCount() or getMostPlayed() to display this data.
///
/// `class` vs `struct`: this is a `class` (a "reference type") rather than a
/// `struct` ("value type") because it needs to be shared — every part of the
/// app that holds a reference to this object sees the SAME data, and changes
/// made in one place are visible everywhere else. A `struct` would instead
/// get copied every time it's passed around, so different parts of the app
/// could end up with different, disconnected copies of the play counts.
///
/// `ObservableObject` is a SwiftUI protocol (a "contract" a type can agree to
/// follow). Conforming to it lets SwiftUI views watch this object and
/// automatically redraw themselves whenever a `@Published` property changes.
class PlayCountManager: ObservableObject {

    // MARK: - Static Reference

    /// Shared instance that AudioPlayer can access via PlayCountManager.shared.
    /// Set in YTMusicApp.init() after the PlayCountManager is created.
    ///
    /// This is a "singleton-style" reference: `static` means this property
    /// belongs to the `PlayCountManager` type itself rather than to any one
    /// instance, so there's exactly one `shared` value for the whole app to
    /// read. It's declared as an `Optional` (`PlayCountManager?`, i.e. it can
    /// be `nil`) because the real instance is created and owned by SwiftUI as
    /// a `@StateObject` in `YTMusicApp`, and only assigned here afterward —
    /// so callers must handle the brief window (and any misconfiguration)
    /// where it hasn't been set yet.

    // MARK: - Published Properties

    /// Dictionary mapping video IDs to their play counts.
    /// Updated whenever a song is played.
    ///
    /// `@Published` is a SwiftUI "property wrapper" — special syntax that
    /// wraps this property with extra behavior. Here, it automatically
    /// announces "this value changed!" to any SwiftUI view that's watching
    /// this object, so the UI can refresh itself. A `[String: Int]` is a
    /// dictionary — a lookup table of key/value pairs, here mapping a song's
    /// video ID (the key) to how many times it's been played (the value).
