/// Donates Siri Shortcut activities so Siri learns user habits.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// iOS records "donated" activities and uses them to suggest Siri Shortcuts.
/// For example, if you always play "Workout Playlist" at 6 PM, Siri will
/// suggest it automatically. Users can also assign voice commands in
/// Settings → Siri & Search → Shortcuts.
///
/// This is a lightweight approach — no custom intent definition files needed.
/// We use NSUserActivity which is the simplest form of Siri integration.
///
/// This is a `struct` with only `static` members — it never gets
/// instantiated (nobody ever writes `SiriShortcutsManager()`). It exists
/// purely as a namespace grouping related functions together, the same way
/// `Foundation`'s `FileManager.default` groups file operations.
///
/// `@MainActor` is a concurrency annotation meaning "this type's code must
/// run on the main thread" (the thread responsible for UI and most
/// Apple-framework work). Marking the whole struct this way guarantees the
/// UIKit/Intents calls below never accidentally run on a background thread,
/// which some system frameworks don't tolerate.
