// MARK: - Liked Songs Manager

/// Manages the user's liked songs locally.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// - Stores liked song video IDs in UserDefaults as a Set<String>
/// - Persists on device (no account needed)
/// - Views check `isLiked(videoId:)` to show heart/filled heart icons
///
/// LIMITATIONS:
/// - Liked songs are LOCAL only — they don't sync with YouTube Music
/// - If the user logs into YouTube Music in the future, we'd need to
///   change this to use the API's `like/like` and `like/removelike` endpoints
///
/// WHAT IS "@MainActor"?
/// This is a concurrency annotation (a rule about which thread code runs on)
/// that pins every method and property of this class to the app's main
/// thread — the same thread that draws the UI. It's required here because
/// this class is an `ObservableObject` whose `@Published` property is read
/// directly by SwiftUI views, and UI updates must always happen on the main
/// thread. Marking the whole class `@MainActor` means the compiler checks
/// this for us and stops us from accidentally calling these methods from a
/// background thread.

    /// here because "is this song liked" is a yes/no membership question —
    /// we never need duplicates or ordering, and `Set.contains` is much
    /// faster than searching through an Array.
    ///
    /// `@Published` (see EqualizerManager.swift for a fuller explanation)
    /// makes SwiftUI views re-render whenever this changes. `private(set)`
    /// means code outside this class can READ `likedIds` but can't assign
