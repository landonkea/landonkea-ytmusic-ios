/// Manages all audio playback in the app.
///
/// RESPONSIBILITIES:
/// - Play, pause, skip, seek songs using AVFoundation
/// - Manage a queue of songs with shuffle and repeat
/// - Show controls on lock screen and Control Center
/// - Support AirPlay and external playback
/// - Handle background audio (music continues when app is backgrounded)
///
/// ARCHITECTURE:
/// - @MainActor: All property changes happen on the main thread (required for UI updates)
/// - ObservableObject: Makes this class observable by SwiftUI views
/// - @Published: When these properties change, SwiftUI views automatically re-render
///
/// HOW VIEWS USE THIS:
/// Views get this via @EnvironmentObject, which means they can:
/// 1. Read properties like currentSong, state, progress
/// 2. Call methods like togglePlayPause(), playNext(), seek(to:)
/// 3. Automatically re-render when any @Published property changes
