/// Manages offline song caching — downloading, storing, and playing cached songs.
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// - Songs are downloaded to the app's Documents/Downloads/ directory
/// - A JSON file tracks which songs are downloaded (metadata + file paths)
/// - When playing a song, we check if it's cached first (saves data + works offline)
/// - Users can delete individual downloads or clear all
///
/// BACKGROUND DOWNLOADS:
/// - Uses a URLSession with a background identifier so iOS continues
///   downloading even when the app is suspended or in the background
/// - The system wakes the app briefly when a download finishes
/// - On cellular, respects the "Wi-Fi Only" setting
///
/// STORAGE LOCATION:
/// iOS apps have a "Documents" directory that persists between launches.
/// We store downloads in Documents/Downloads/ and the index in Documents/downloads.json.
///
/// LIMITATIONS:
/// - Cached songs are deleted if the user uninstalls the app
/// - Stream URLs expire after a few hours, so cached audio files are the only
///   thing that persists — we can't re-download with the same URL
/// - Storage is limited by the device's available space
