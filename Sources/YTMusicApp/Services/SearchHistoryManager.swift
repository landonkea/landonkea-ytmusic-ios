// MARK: - Search History Manager

/// Manages the user's search history — saving, loading, and clearing past searches.
///
/// RESPONSIBILITIES:
/// - Save search queries when the user performs a search
/// - Load history from disk on app launch
/// - Provide history to the search view for display
/// - Allow clearing individual entries or all history
///
/// STORAGE:
/// - Uses a JSON file in the Documents directory
/// - Limited to 20 entries to keep the list manageable
/// - Most recent searches appear first
///
/// HOW IT WORKS:
/// When the user performs a search, SearchView calls addSearch().
/// This method prepends the query to the list, removes duplicates,
/// trims to 20 entries, and saves to disk. The search view reads
/// `searches` to display recent searches when the search bar is focused.
///
/// This is a `class` (reference type), not a `struct` (value type), so that
/// every part of the app sharing this object sees the exact same history —
/// there's one shared instance, not separate copies. Conforming to
/// `ObservableObject` lets SwiftUI views watch it and re-render themselves
/// automatically whenever its `@Published` data changes.
