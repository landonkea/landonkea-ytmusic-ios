// MARK: - App Entry Point

/// The main entry point for the YouTube Music iOS app.
///
/// HOW SWIFTUI APPS WORK:
/// - The `@main` attribute tells Swift this is where the app starts
/// - `App` protocol requires a `body` property that returns a `Scene`
/// - `WindowGroup` creates the app's window (supports multiple windows on iPad/Mac)
/// - We inject shared objects via `.environmentObject()` so all child views can access them
///
/// OBJECT LIFECYCLE:
/// - `@StateObject` creates the object when the app launches and keeps it alive
/// - It's only created ONCE (not recreated when the view re-renders)
/// - The object persists for the entire app lifetime
@main

// MARK: - API Client

/// A wrapper around InnerTubeClient that works with SwiftUI's data flow.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS:
/// InnerTubeClient is a plain Swift class. SwiftUI needs an ObservableObject
/// to automatically update views when data changes. This class:
/// 1. Holds the InnerTubeClient instance
/// 2. Caches results (search results, home feed) in @Published properties
/// 3. Manages loading state (isLoading) so views can show spinners
/// 4. Catches errors and stores them for views to display
///
/// @MainActor ensures all @Published property updates happen on the main thread,
/// which is required for SwiftUI to observe them correctly.
@MainActor
class APIClient: ObservableObject {
    
    /// The actual API client that makes HTTP requests to YouTube.
    /// This is NOT @Published because views don't need to observe it directly —
    /// they observe the results stored in @Published properties below.
    let client = InnerTubeClient()
    
    /// The latest search results. Views observe this to display results.
    /// When this changes, any view using @EnvironmentObject var apiClient: APIClient
    /// will automatically re-render to show the new results.
    @Published var searchResults: [SearchResult] = []
    
    /// The home feed sections (e.g. "Quick Picks", "Trending").
    /// Populated by loadHome(), displayed by HomeView.
    @Published var homeSections: [BrowseSection] = []
    
    /// Trending charts sections from YouTube Music.
    /// Populated by loadCharts(), displayed in HomeView.
    @Published var chartsSections: [BrowseSection] = []
    
    /// Whether an API request is currently in progress.
    /// Views use this to show loading spinners.
    @Published var isLoading: Bool = false
    
    /// Error message from the last failed request.
    /// Views can display this as an alert or banner.
    /// nil = no error.

    ///   - query: The search term (e.g. "Bohemian Rhapsody")
    ///   - filter: Optional filter — "songs", "videos", "albums", or nil for all
    ///
    /// HOW IT WORKS:
    /// 1. Trim whitespace and check for empty query (prevents useless API calls)
    /// 2. Set isLoading = true (views show spinner)
    /// 3. Call the InnerTube API with optional filter
    /// 4. On success: store results in searchResults (views update)
    /// 5. On failure: store error message (views can show it)
    /// 6. Set isLoading = false (spinner disappears)
