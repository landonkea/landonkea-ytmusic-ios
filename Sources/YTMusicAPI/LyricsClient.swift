///    highlighting, so it's strictly preferred when it has the song.
///    - `GET /api/get?track_name=X&artist_name=Y` — exact match lookup
///    - `GET /api/search?q=X` — fuzzy search (used as a fallback within
///      lrclib itself, before we ever fall through to provider #2)
/// 2. lyrics.ovh — tried only if lrclib has nothing at all (404s or
///    returns no lyrics for both the exact-match and search lookups).
///    Also free and no auth, but plain-text only — no timestamps, so
///    songs resolved through this path never get karaoke highlighting.
///    Still strictly better than showing nothing.
///    - `GET /v1/{artist}/{title}`
///
/// Both providers require NO LOGIN — everything here works anonymously.
