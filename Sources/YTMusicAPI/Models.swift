// MARK: - Overview

/// Simple, clean data models for the UI layer.
///
/// HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM InnerTubeModels.swift:
/// - InnerTubeModels.swift = complex models that mirror YouTube's nested JSON
/// - Models.swift = simple models that our SwiftUI views actually use
///
/// We convert from InnerTube models to these simple models before passing
/// data to views. This keeps the UI code clean and decoupled from YouTube's
/// internal API format.

// MARK: - Search Result

/// A single search result (song, video, etc.).
///
/// Created from YouTube's search response. Used by SearchView to display results.
struct SearchResult: Identifiable, Hashable {

    /// YouTube thumbnails follow a predictable URL pattern:
    ///   https://i.ytimg.com/vi/{videoId}/{size}.jpg
    ///
    /// Available sizes:
    /// - `default.jpg` = 120x90
    /// - `mqdefault.jpg` = 320x180 (medium quality — we use this)
    /// - `hqdefault.jpg` = 480x360 (high quality)
    /// - `sddefault.jpg` = 640x480 (standard definition)

/// stream URL, which is NOT available in search/browse responses.

/// after the URL expires, we'd need to fetch a fresh one.
