// EqualizerEngineTests.swift — Runtime regression test for the
// EqualizerEngine crash bug that a prior cleanup pass fixed.
//
// THE BUG: EqualizerEngine used to call engine.connect(node, to: ...)
// in buildGraph() WITHOUT ever calling engine.attach(node) first.
// AVAudioEngine.connect(_:to:format:) throws an uncaught Objective-C
// exception (NSInternalInconsistencyException) — not a catchable Swift
// error — if either node hasn't been attached to the engine first. That
// exception crashes the process. It reproduced every time a user turned
// the equalizer on and played a downloaded (local-file) song, because
// that's the only path that calls EqualizerEngine.playFile(), which
// calls buildGraph(), which calls engine.connect().
//
// THE FIX: attach playerNode/timePitch/eqNode to the engine exactly once,
// in init(), before any connect() call can happen.
//
// THIS TEST exercises the real runtime path: it creates an actual local
// audio file on disk (a synthesized WAV — no bundled fixture needed),
// instantiates a real EqualizerEngine, and calls playFile() on it. This
// runs the exact sequence that used to crash: buildGraph() ->
// engine.connect(playerNode, to: timePitch, ...) etc. If attach() were
// ever removed again, this test would crash the test process (an
// uncaught NSException isn't something XCTest can catch as a normal
// assertion failure — the test run would abort/fail), which is exactly
// the regression this test exists to catch.
